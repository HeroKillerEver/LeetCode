## Idea

This problem will not take you a lot of time to think about the **Binary Search** method. However, I still don't understand why in the test case there is `[[]]`, this doesn't make sense to be at least since what is the point you search for a `0 * 0` matrix. I know when we write algorithms, we should consider _boundaries_, but the _boundaries_ should at least make sense right?

_Note_: 

time complexity: `O(lgmn)`

space complexity: `O(1)`
